# Project_PowerBI_Patient.Wait.List
## Project Overview

This Power BI dashboard analyzes and visualizes patient waitlist data to help healthcare providers monitor, optimize, and manage patient queues efficiently.
The dashboard offers insights into wait times, patient flow, and resource utilization, enabling better decision-making for improving patient care and service delivery.

Key Objectives:

Monitor patient wait times:
Track how long patients have been waiting for appointments, treatments, or procedures.
Identify bottlenecks: Detect points in the process where delays are occurring.
Optimize resource allocation: Help healthcare providers manage staff and resources to reduce patient wait times.
Prioritize patients: Identify high-priority patients who require urgent care based on wait time and other factors.

Key Features:

Wait Time Overview: Visual representation of average wait times segmented by department, appointment type, or provider.
Patient Priority: Identify high-risk or long-waiting patients for priority scheduling.
Resource Utilization: Visualize staff allocation and patient inflow/outflow trends to better distribute healthcare resources.
Patient Demographics: Insights into the types of patients waiting (e.g., age, gender, condition type).
Trend Analysis: Track changes in wait times over time to identify trends or seasonal variations.

Usage:

1.Download the patient_waitlist.pbix file.
2.Open it using Power BI Desktop.

Future Enhancements:

1.Add predictive analytics to forecast future patient wait times.
2.Include more detailed demographic analysis for better patient flow management.
3.Integrate real-time data from healthcare systems for live monitoring.
